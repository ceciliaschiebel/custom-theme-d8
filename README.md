# Sub-Theme based on Drupal Bootstrap

This sub-theme applies a few templating and style changes to the original Drupal Bootstrap theme.

Read the [Sub-theming](https://drupal-bootstrap.org/api/bootstrap/docs%21Sub-Theming.md/group/sub_theming/8) topic for more information about how this sub-theme was created.

- [Installation](#installation)

## Prerequisite
Since this is a sub-theme, you need to install [Drupal Bootstrap](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap) first.

To do this, go to you admin panel, click on Appearance and then, click on **+ Install new theme**.

Once there, on the field **Install from a URL**, paste the following URL: `https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/bootstrap-8.x-3.13.tar.gz` and click **Install**

If that option is not available, download the file from `https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/bootstrap-8.x-3.13.tar.gz`, unzip it and copy the folder `bootstrap` into you project's `themes` folder. On the admin panel, click install on the theme.

## Installation
Copy the folder `custom` of this repository into the folder `themes` of your project.

Back to your Admin panel, you will see a new theme called **custom**, install and set as default.
